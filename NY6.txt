Most Americans have had it with this election. The major party presidential nominees are the most disliked candidates in the modern era; the electorate is as angry and cynical as it has ever been. On top of all that, the upcoming election will probably leave us with divided government – a Democrat in the White House, but Republicans in control of at least one house of Congress. Yet another reason for pessimism, right?

Wrong. Divided government is likely to prevail, but there are actually good reasons to prefer it to the alternative. In fact, the best possible outcome of this election may well be for the current arrangement – a Democrat in the White House and Republicans in control of both houses of Congress – to continue. It may sound a little wacky to argue for the status quo at a time when many Americans have lost faith in Washington, D.C. But for all the talk of a "do-nothing" legislative branch, the current Republican Congress has done more than many people think. It has overhauled the No Child Left Behind education law, reformed controversial surveillance programs and passed a major transportation bill. These undertakings required considerable bipartisanship, including cooperation with a Democratic president.
